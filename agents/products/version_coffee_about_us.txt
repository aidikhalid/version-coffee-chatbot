## Our Story

Founded in 2018, Version Coffee began as a passion-driven café with one clear vision: to serve high-quality, ethically sourced coffee while creating a welcoming space for the Kuala Lumpur community.

Inspired by Malaysia’s rich café culture and global coffee traditions, our journey has taken us to renowned coffee-growing regions across Asia and Latin America. We work closely with trusted farms and cooperatives to ensure that every bean reflects care, sustainability, and craftsmanship. Our beans are carefully roasted to highlight their unique flavor profiles—delivering a cup that’s bold, balanced, and memorable.

Every brew at Version Coffee tells a story—from farm to cup.
